## Installation
Before starting, users may want to see what shell is currently being used:
```zsh
echo $SHELL
```

Make sure that Zsh has been installed correctly by running the following in a terminal:
```zsh
zsh
```

You should now see _zsh-newuser-install_, which will walk you through some basic configuration. If you want to skip this, press `q`. If you did not see it, you can invoke it manually with:
```zsh
autoload -Uz zsh-newuser-install
zsh-newuser-install -f
```
